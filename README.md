# unemployment
I was analyzing an unemployment rate data set that I got from Kaggle. I used R when working on this. The five variables that I looked at were year, month, state, county, and rate. I was focusing a lot on the unemployment rate variable. I made a lot of histograms that showed how frequent the unemployment rates were. I also made some line graphs where how the unemployment rate in a county was like in a year and see if it increased or decreased. I also made some box and whisker plots. I had some box and whisker plots where I was looking at some of the states and their unemployment rates and I had a box and whisker plot where I was looking at some of the counties and their unemployment rates.
